## Eggonomics

Eggonomics is a web-based mobile application designed to help users shop smarter, cheaper, and reduce waste. 
Our team has created an app to help users track the prices of everyday household goods and aid them in reducing food waste. Inflation and the global pandemic has increased the financial burdens of shopping for groceries. We hope that Eggonomics can help users have an easier time shopping for foods.
Eggonomics provides users with a price tracker, shopping list, food pantry list, and data analytics on spending and food waste.

Eggonomics was created by Leo Shen, Jimmy Wong, and Fonse Clarito.
